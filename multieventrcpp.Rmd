```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Download the 'multievent.cpp' and 'titi2.txt' files. This code implements the matrix product by hand.
```{r}
Rcpp::sourceCpp('multievent.cpp')
```
The Rcpp code is `r res2$median[1]/res2$median[2]` times faster than basic R.

Following the advice of both Dirk Eddelbuettel and Romain Francois, I have switched to RcppArmadillo to rely on 'the matrix code by professionals and decades of testing (LAPACK and BLAS)'.
```{r}
Rcpp::sourceCpp('multieventarmadillo.cpp')
```

Now the RcppArmadillo code is `r res2$median[1]/res2$median[2]` times faster than basic R!!
